%% Some case of the ratio test or l'hospitals rule
\begin{exercise}{1} Suppose the $(x_n)$ and $(y_n)$ are sequences that $\lim_{n \to  \infty} x_n = L$ and $\lim_{n \to  \infty} x_n = \infty$.
  Show that $\lim_{n \to  \infty} x_n/y_n = 0$. 
\end{exercise}

%% Induction, true on order 0 and 1. Suppose its true for order n. Consider an order n+1 polynomial f = (x - a)q(x). By The induction hypothesis,
%% we know that f has at most n roots.
\begin{exercise}{2} A number is algebraic if it is a solution of a polynomial equation,
  \begin{equation*}
    a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\dots+a_1x + a_0 = 0
  \end{equation*}
  Where each $a_k$ is an integer, $n \geq 1$ and $a_n \neq 0$. Show that the collection of all algebraic 
  number is countable.\\
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}{3} Let $p$ be a fifth order polynomial, so $p(x) = \sum_{k = 1}^5 a_kx^k$ where each 
  $a_k \in \Reals$, and $a_5 \neq 0$. Prove that there exists a solution of $p(x) = 0$.\\

%Algebraic Limit theorem then use a p seris argument. Look for a proof of the root test
\begin{exercise}{4} Let $\sum_{k = 1}^{\infty}a_k$ be a series. Suppose moreover that $\lim_{k \to \infty} |a_k|^{\frac{1}{k}}$
  exists and equals $L$. Show that the series converges absolutely if $L<1$ and diverges if $L>1$. \\
\end{exercise}

%Show compactness on the interval [x, x+L], or show that f is bounded and the use the definition of uniform convergence
\begin{exercise}{5} We say that a function $f: \Reals \to \Reals$ is periodic if there is a number $L$ such that $f(x) = f(x + L)$
  for all $x \in \Reals$. Show that a continuous, periodic function is uniformly continuous.\\

\begin{exercise}{6} Use the Nested interval Property to deduce the Axiom of Completeness without using any other form of the Axiom of
  Completeness.HINT: Look at the proof of the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem.\\
  
\end{exercise}

% Use the density of rationals to get a sequence or rationals to $c$. Note that every sequence of irrational numbers converging to 
% c is sandwiched by a sequence of rationals converging to $c$ thus the function is continuous on irrationals. 
\begin{exercise}{7} Let $(r_n)$ be an enumeration of the rational numbers. Define $f: \Reals \to \Reals$ by 
  \begin{equation*}
    f(x) = 
    \begin{cases} 
      \dfrac{1}{n} & x = r_n \\
      0 & x \not\in \Rats 
   \end{cases}
  \end{equation*}
  Determine, with proof, where $f$ is continuous.\\

\begin{exercise}{8} Let $g$ be defined on an interval $A$, and let $c \in A.$\\
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Explain why $g'(c)$ in Definition 5.2.1 could have been given by,
    \begin{equation*}
      g'(c) = \lim_{h \to 0} \dfrac{g(c+h) - g(c)}{h}.
    \end{equation*}

    \item  Assume $A$ is open. If $g$ is differentiable at $c \in A$, show
    \begin{equation*}
      g'(c) = \lim_{h \to 0} \dfrac{g(c+h) - g(c - h)}{2h}

% By contradiction suppose that there is a solution to f(x) = x, By the definition of the derivative we know that,
%f'(x) = 1. Since the f">0 we know that f" is strictly increasing, since f'(1)<1 we know that f'(x)<x
\begin{exercise}{10} Suppose that $f: [0,1] \to \Reals$ is twice differentiable, $f(0) > 0$, $f(1) = 1$, 
  and $f'(1) < 1$. Suppose also that $f'' > 0$ on $[0,1]$. Show that there does not exist a solution of the equation
  $f(x) = x$ in $[0,1)$.
