\begin{exercise}{Abbott 4.3.9} Assume $h : \Reals \to \Reals$ is continuous on $\Reals$ and let $k = \{x : h(x) = 0\}$. Show that $k$
  is a closed set.\\
  \begin{proof} Suppose $h : \Reals \to \Reals$ is continuous on $\Reals$ and $k = \{x : h(x) = 0\}$. Let $x$ be a limit point of $k$, by 
    Theorem 3.2.5 there exists a sequence $(a_n) \in k$ such that $lim a_n = x$ where $a_n \neq x$ for all $n \in \Nats$. By Theorem 4.3.2 (iii) since $h$ is continoues
    for all $(a_n) \to x$ it follows that $h(a_n) \to h(x)$. Note that since $a_n \in k$ we know that $h(a_n) = 0$ for all $n$ and therefore we know that $h(x) = 0$ an thus by definition we get that $x \in k$. 
    Thus $k$ contains all its limit points and is therefore closed. 
  \end{proof}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}{Supplemental 1}
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
\item Show that a continuous function on all of $\Reals$ that equals zero
on the rational numbers must be the zero function\\
\begin{proof}
Suppose $f : \Reals \to \Reals$ is continuos and that for all $q \in \Rats$ we know that $f(q) = 0$. By Theorem 3.2.10 for every $x \in \Reals$
there exists a sequence $(q_n) \in \Rats$ such that $(q_n) \to x$. By the continuity of $f$ we know that $f(q_n) \to f(x)$, since all $q_n \in \Rats$ by definitinon of $f$
we know that $f(q_n) = 0$ and thus $f(x) = 0$ for all $x \in \Reals$.










f(x) = 0 for all x \in R
\end{proof}






\item Suppose $f$ and $g$ are two continuous functions on the real
numbers. Is it true that if $f(q)=g(q)$ for all $q\in\Rats$, then $f$ and $g$
are the same function?
\end{enumerate}	
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}{Supplemental 2}
 Suppose $K\subseteq \Reals$ is compact.  Show that
there exists $x_M\in K$ such that $x_M\ge x$ for all $x\in K$.  Then,
with very little work, show that there exists $x_m\in K$ such
that $x_m \le x$ for all $x\in K$.
