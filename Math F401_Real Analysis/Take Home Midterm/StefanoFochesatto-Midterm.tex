\begin{exercise}{1}Let $A$ and $B$ be non empty sets that are bounded above.Suppose $\sup A < \sup B$. Prove that there is an element in $B$ that is an
	upper bound for $A$.\\

	\begin{proof}
		Suppose that $A$ and $B$ be non empty sets that are bounded above and that $\sup A < \sup B$. Let $x = \sup A$ and $y = \sup B$. Now consider some $z$
		such that, $0 < z < y-x$. Through some algebra we can see that, $x < y - z$  and therefore the term $y - z$ must be an upper bound for $A$ since it is larger than its least upper bound. Also 
		note that $y - z < y$ and therefore $y-z$ must be contained in $B$.
	\end{proof}

\begin{exercise}{2} In class we proved that $\Nats^2$ is countably infinite. Use this fact and a proof by induction to show that $\Nats^n$ is countably infinite for every $n \in \Nats$. \\

  \begin{proof}
    Consider the base case where $n = 1$, clearly $\Nats^1$ is countably infinite and we have proven that $\Nats^2$ is countably infinite. We will proceed by induction on $n$. 
    Suppose there exists some $n\in \Nats$ such that $\Nats^n$ is countably infinite. By the induction hypothesis there exists some bijection 
     $g: \Nats^n \to \Nats$. Now consider the bijection we proved in class $f: \Nats^2 \to \Nats$. Note that the composition of these two functions gives us, 
     $f\circ g: \Nats^{n+1} \to \Nats $ and since $f\circ g$ is a composition of bijections it must also be a bijection. Thus by induction we have shown that for all $n\in \Nats$
     $\Nats^n$ is countably infinite.     
  \end{proof}

\begin{exercise} {4} Let $(x_n)$ and $(y_n)$ be given, and define $(z_n)$ to be the "shuffled"
  sequence $(x_1,y_1,x_2,y_2,\dots,x_n,y_n,\dots)$. Prove that $(z_n)$ is convergent if and only if 
  $(x_n)$ and $(y_n)$ are both convergent with $\lim x_n = \lim y_n$.\\

\begin{proof}
  Suppose convergent sequences $(x_n)$ and $(y_n)$ such that $\lim x_n = \lim y_n = l$. consider a sequence $(z_n)$ such that
  $(x_1,y_1,x_2,y_2,\dots,x_n,y_n,\dots)$. Note that $(z_{2n}) = (y_n)$ and $(z_{2n-1}) = (x_n)$. Let $\epsilon > 0$. Since 
  $(x_n)$ and $(y_n)$ converge we know that there exists $N_x,N_y \in \Nats$ such that,
  \begin{equation*}
    |x_n - l|<\epsilon,
  \end{equation*}
  \begin{equation*}
    |y_n - l|<\epsilon.
  \end{equation*}
  Consider an $N \in \Nats$ such that $N = \max(N_x,N_m)$. By substitution we get that for all odd and even values of $(z_n)$ we get,
  \begin{equation*}
    |z_n - l| < \epsilon.
  \end{equation*}
Thus $(z_n)$ is convergent. 
\end{proof}
\vspace{.25 in}

\begin{proof}
  Suppose a sequence $(z_n) =(x_1,y_1,x_2,y_2,\dots,x_n,y_n,\dots)$ is convergent to some limit $(z_n) \to l$. By Theorem 2.5.2
  we know that all subsequences of $(z_n)$ must converge to the same limit. Consider some $a \in x_n$ such that $x_i = a$. Note that $x_i = z_{2i-1}$
  and therefore $a \in z_n$. Similarly for some $b \in y_n$ such that $y_i = b$ we know that $y_i = z_{2i}$ and therefore $b \in z_n$. Thus both $x_n$ and $y_n$
  are subsequences of $z_n$ and therefore $\lim z_n = \lim x_n = \lim y_n$.
\end{proof}

\begin{exercise}{5} Suppose $F$ is a collection of open intervals such that if $I,J \in F$ and $I \neq J$, then $I \cap J = \emptyset$. Prove that $F$ is countable.\\

  \begin{proof}
    Suppose $F$ is a collection of open intervals such that each interval is disjoint. Note since all 
    intervals are disjoint it must follow that the pair of $\sup J$ and $\inf J$ is unique for all $J \in F$. Consider the sequence of ordered pairs,
    \begin{equation*}
      a_n = (\inf(J_1),\sup(J_1)),\dots,(\inf(J_n),\sup(J_n)).
    \end{equation*}
    Where for all $n \in \Nats$.
    \begin{equation*}
      \sup J_n \leq \sup J_{n+1}
    \end{equation*}
    \begin{equation*}
      \inf J_n \leq \inf J_{n+1}
    \end{equation*}
    Now consider the function $f: F \to \Nats$ defined by $f(a_n) = n$. Clearly the function defined by this sequence is injective and therefore $F$ is countable. 
    
  \end{proof}

\begin{exercise}{6} Let $(x_n)$ be a sequence converging to $L$. Define,
  \begin{equation*}
    y_n = \dfrac{x_1+\dots+x_n}{n}.
  \end{equation*}
  That is $y_n$ is the average of the first $n$ terms of the $x_n$ sequence. Show that $y_n = L$ as well. \\

\begin{proof}
  Suppose that the sequence $(x_n)$ is convergent to $L$. Therefore by definition for all $\epsilon > 0$,
  \begin{equation*}
    |x_n - L|< \epsilon.
  \end{equation*} 
  Now consider the expression,
  \begin{equation*}
    |y_n - L| = |\dfrac{x_1+\dots+x_n}{n} - L|.
  \end{equation*}
  Through some algebra we get,
  \begin{align*}
    |y_n - L|&= \dfrac{1}{n}|(x_1+\dots+x_n) - nL|,\\
            &= \dfrac{1}{n}|(x_1 - L)+\dots+(x_n - L)|.
  \end{align*}
  By triangle inequality,
  \begin{equation*}
    |y_n - L|  \le \dfrac{1}{n}|(x_1 - L)|+\dots+|(x_n - L)|.
  \end{equation*}
  Since $(x_n)$ is convergent to $L$ we know that for all $\epsilon > 0$ there exists an $N\in \Nats$ such that for all $n \geq N$,
  \begin{equation*}
    |x_n - L|< \epsilon.
  \end{equation*} 
  By substitution we know that,
\begin{align*}
  |y_n - L| &< \dfrac{n \epsilon}{n},\\
  &< \epsilon.
\end{align*}
Thus $y_n$ is convergent with $y_n \to L$.
\end{proof}

\begin{exercise}{7} Use the Bolzano Weierstrass Theorem to prove the Monotone Convergence Theorem 
  without assuming any other form of the Axiom of Completeness.\\
  
  \begin{proof} Consider $(a_n)$, a monotone and bounded sequence. Without loss of generality let's assume
    the $(a_n)$ is monotone increasing. By Bolzano Weierstrass we know that there exists a convergent subsequence of $(a_n)$,
    $(a_{n_k}) \to L$. Therefore for all $\epsilon > 0$ there exists an $K \in \Nats$ such that for all $k \geq K$,
    \begin{equation*}
      |(a_{n_k})| < \epsilon.
    \end{equation*} 
    \begin{align*}
      |(a_{n_k}) - L| &< \epsilon\\
      -\epsilon < &(a_{n_k}) - L < \epsilon\\
      L - \epsilon < &(a_{n_k})< \epsilon + L
    \end{align*}
    Let $N = n_K$, note that for all $n \geq N$ there exists a $k \geq K$, such that
    \begin{equation*}
      a_{n_k} \le a_n \le a_{n_{k+1}}.
    \end{equation*}
    Thus we get the following inequality
    \begin{equation*}
      L - \epsilon < a_{n_k} \le a_n \le a_{n_{k+1}}< \epsilon + L.
    \end{equation*}
    Therefore $a_n$ converges to $L$. 
  \end{proof}




  \begin{exercise}{8} Suppose $(x_n)$ is a sequence and that for all $n \geq 2$,
    \begin{equation*}
      |x_{n+1} - x_n| \le \dfrac{1}{2} |x_n - x_{n-1}|.
    \end{equation*}
    Show that the sequence $(x_n)$ converges. \\

    \begin{proof}
      Suppose $(x_n)$ is a sequence and that for all $n \geq 2$,
      \begin{equation*}
        |x_{n+1} - x_n| \le \dfrac{1}{2} |x_n - x_{n-1}|.
      \end{equation*}


    \end{proof}
